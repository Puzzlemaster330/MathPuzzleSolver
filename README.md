# MathPuzzleSolver
Inputs a value 'a' and a number 'd', and using only the number any number of times, it must equate to the value.

For eg,a=7,d=4;
Expression:- (4+4+4)รท4+4=7

or a=14,d=5;
Expression:- ((5+5+5)x5-5)รท5=14

This java file implements recursion and backtracking to solve the problem.
